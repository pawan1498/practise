here we can learn how recursive approach can be using during problem solving 
by following example.

A good hint that problem is recursive is that IT CAN BE BUILT OF SUBPROBLEM.


HOW TO APPROACH :
recursive solution , by defination ,are built off of solution to subproblem.Many time this will mean simply to 
compute f(n) by adding something ,or otherwise changing the solution for f(n-1).
there are many ways you might divide the problem into subproblem. three of most common approaches to develop an 
algorithm are BOTTOM-UP ,TOP-DOWN ,HALF-AND-HALF.
